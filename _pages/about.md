I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Vision at Zhejiang University's ReLER Lab, where I'm fortunate to work with Prof. [Yi Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RMSuNFwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My passion lies in developing the next generation of virtual humans and ensuring the security of the content they (and other AI) generate. Before my PhD, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in computer science from Nanjing University. Now, as I'm wrapping up my doctorate, I'm eager to join a collaborative team as a postdoc and contribute to the development of human-centric AI.
