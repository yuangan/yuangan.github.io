I am a final-year Ph.D. student under the supervision of Prof. [Yi Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RMSuNFwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at the ReLER lab, Zhejiang University. My research focuses on virtual human generation and privacy protection. I am actively seeking a postdoctoral position. If interested, please feel free to contact me at: ganyuan@zju.edu.cn.
