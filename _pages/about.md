I'm a Project Assistant Professor in [Prof. Harada](https://www.mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/harada/)'s Lab, RCAST at UTokyo. My passion lies in developing the next generation of virtual humans and ensuring the security of the generated content. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Yi Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RMSuNFwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I also received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science from Nanjing University.
